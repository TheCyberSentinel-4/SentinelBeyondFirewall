# SentinelBeyondFirewall- Securing Web Application Infrastructure â€“ A Multi-Layered Approach

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **multi-layered security architecture** to protect a web application from external threats.  
The design covers **network security, application security, monitoring, centralized logging, and data protection** with disaster recovery in mind.

## ðŸ›  Architecture Flow

1. **Router â†’ PFsense Firewall + Suricata IDS/IPS**
   - PFsense acts as the network firewall.
   - Suricata performs intrusion detection and prevention.

2. **Web Server (Apache)**
   - Hosts the application.
   - Only accepts traffic allowed by firewall and IPS rules.

3. **PRTG Network Monitor**
   - Monitors performance, uptime, and device health.
   - Generates alerts for anomalies.

4. **Grafana + Loki + Promtail**
   - Centralized log collection and visualization.
   - Promtail ships logs, Loki stores them, Grafana visualizes them.

5. **Database Layer (MySQL in Private Network)**
   - Isolated private network access.
   - Only web server communicates with the database.

6. **Backup System**
   - Automated backups for logs and database dumps.
   - Ensures disaster recovery.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- Multi-layered security implementation.
- Real-time monitoring and alerting.
- Centralized logging for incident investigation.
- Secure database isolation.
- Automated backups for business continuity.

## ðŸ’» Tools & Technologies Used
- **PFsense** â€“ Network firewall.
- **Suricata** â€“ Intrusion Detection & Prevention.
- **PRTG** â€“ Infrastructure monitoring.
- **Grafana** â€“ Dashboard visualization.
- **Loki** â€“ Centralized log storage.
- **Promtail** â€“ Log shipping agent.
- **MySQL** â€“ Relational database.
- **Debian** â€“ OS for deployment.

## âš  Challenges Faced
- **Suricata false positives** â€“ Required fine-tuning detection rules.
- **Log normalization** â€“ Standardizing different log formats for Loki.
- **Grafana performance optimization** â€“ Improved dashboard load times.
- **Private network database monitoring** â€“ Securely enabled metric collection.
- **Debian â€˜deluserâ€™ issue** â€“ Removing a user with multiple active processes required identifying and terminating them before deletion.
